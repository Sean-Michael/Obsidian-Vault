## Overview  
Give a short introduction to what this tutorial covers, why itâ€™s useful, and what the reader will achieve.

## Prerequisites  
- List any tools, versions, or prior knowledge needed.
- Example:
  - Linux (Ubuntu 22.04)
  - Docker & Kubernetes installed
  - Basic familiarity with YAML

---

## Step 1: **Setting Up the Environment**  
Explain the first step clearly, using **code blocks** and commands.

```sh
# Install Minikube on Ubuntu
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
```

If needed, include **expected output**:

```
ðŸŽ‰  minikube installed successfully!
```

---

## Step 2: **Running Your First Pod**  
Explain the next step with **context and explanation**.

1. Create a simple Kubernetes Pod definition:
   
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: my-first-pod
   spec:
     containers:
       - name: nginx
         image: nginx:latest
   ```
   
2. Apply the YAML:
   
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f my-first-pod.yaml
   ```

---

## Step 3: **Verifying and Debugging**  
- Check if the pod is running:
  
  ```sh
  kubectl get pods
  ```
  
- If there's an error, describe how to troubleshoot.

## Common Issues & Fixes  
| Issue              | Solution                                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `ImagePullBackOff` | Check if the image exists, run `docker pull nginx:latest` |
| `CrashLoopBackOff` | Inspect logs with `kubectl logs my-first-pod` |

---

## Next Steps  
- Suggest where to go next (e.g., "Now that we have a basic pod running, let's explore services in the next post.")
